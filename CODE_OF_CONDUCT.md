# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in vibekit a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

**Positive behaviour includes:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

**Unacceptable behaviour includes:**

- The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by opening a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/vibedx/vibekit/security/advisories/new) or contacting the maintainers directly via the npm package page.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
